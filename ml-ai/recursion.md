## Recursion in Python: A Deep Dive

---

### What is Recursion?

Recursion is a programming technique where a function solves a problem by repeatedly calling itself with smaller versions of the problem.  Think of it as a set of Russian nesting dolls â€“ each doll is a smaller version of the one before.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Base Case:**  The condition that stops the recursion, preventing infinite loops.
2. **Recursive Case:**  The function calls itself with a slightly modified (usually smaller) input, continuing until the base case is met.

### Python Implementation

Python supports recursion naturally. Let's illustrate with the classic factorial calculation:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:       # Base Case
        return 1
    else:            # Recursive Case
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
